# docuseal-openapi

API client / fetch wrapper for Docuseal, generated using `@hey-api/typescript` and `@hey-api/fetch`.

## How to use
Import the package using the Github link (until I get around to publishing on an actual package manager). For instance, in Bun, run:
```
bun i git+https://github.com/Nmans01/docuseal-openapi.git
```
I have left the code untouched from how it was generated by `@hey-api/typescript` (more info [here](https://heyapi.vercel.app/openapi-ts/get-started.html#quick-start)). To initialize it, simply import and set your client config. Set `baseUrl` to `https://api.docuseal.co` unless you are self-hosting.
```ts
import * as docuseal from "docuseal-openapi";

const apiKey = process.env.DOCUSEAL_SECRET;

docuseal.client.setConfig({
    baseUrl: "https://api.docuseal.co",
    headers: {
        "X-Auth-Token": apiKey
    }
});
```
Every route is exported from the generated code as its own function. By using a `* as docuseal` import, all routes are autocomplete-able using the `docuseal` object.

### Some notes
- While I am used to route parameters being referred to in most contexts as "params" in shorthand, hey-api refers to route parameter values as "path". Therefore, when calling a route fuction such as `docuseal.getTemplate`, it is important to note that passing in the `id` route parameter will look like this:
```ts
docuseal.getTemplate({ path: { id: 123 } });
```
